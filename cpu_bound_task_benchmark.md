## Key Insights

### 1. **Wall Clock Time (Real Time)**
- **Threads**: 0.7320 seconds (136.8% slower)
- **Processes**: 0.3091 seconds
- **Analysis**: Processes completed the CPU-bound task more than twice as fast as threads

### 2. **CPU Utilization**
- **Threads**: Sequential CPU usage
  - High user time (0.7212s) - all computation done in main thread
  - Low system time (0.0110s) - minimal kernel overhead
  - Zero child process time - no parallel processing

- **Processes**: Parallel CPU usage
  - Very low user time (0.0002s) - main process does minimal work
  - Low system time (0.0121s) - process management overhead
  - High child process time (0.9937s total) - actual computation distributed across processes

### 3. **Why Processes Excel at CPU-Bound Tasks**

#### **True Parallelism**
- Processes bypass Ruby's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- Each process can utilize a separate CPU core simultaneously
- Work is distributed across multiple processes running in parallel

#### **CPU Core Utilization**
- Threads are limited by GIL - only one thread can execute Ruby code at a time
- Processes can run on different CPU cores without GIL restrictions
- Better utilization of multi-core systems

#### **Work Distribution**
- Main process coordinates and distributes work
- Child processes handle the actual computation
- Parallel execution reduces total wall clock time

### 4. **Thread Limitations with CPU-Bound Tasks**

#### **GIL Constraint**
- Ruby's Global Interpreter Lock prevents true parallel execution
- Only one thread can execute Ruby code at any given time
- Other threads must wait for the GIL to be released

#### **Sequential Execution**
- CPU-bound tasks in threads execute sequentially
- No benefit from multiple CPU cores
- Total execution time equals sum of all individual task times

#### **Resource Underutilization**
- Multiple CPU cores remain idle during thread execution
- Inefficient use of available hardware resources

### 5. **Process Overhead vs Benefits**
- **Overhead**: Process creation and management (0.1817s system time)
- **Benefits**: Parallel execution across multiple CPU cores
- **Net Result**: 136.8% faster execution despite overhead

## Conclusion

For CPU-bound tasks like prime number calculations, **processes are significantly more efficient** than threads because:

1. **Faster execution**: 136.8% improvement in wall clock time
2. **True parallelism**: Bypasses Ruby's GIL limitations
3. **Better CPU utilization**: Leverages multiple CPU cores
4. **Scalable performance**: Performance improves with more CPU cores

This benchmark clearly demonstrates that for CPU-intensive operations, the overhead of process creation is far outweighed by the benefits of true parallel execution.

## Concluding Statement

### **Practical Implications for Application Design**

The benchmark results provide clear guidance for choosing the right concurrency model:

**Use Processes When:**
- Performing CPU-intensive calculations
- Processing large datasets with complex algorithms
- Running independent computational tasks
- When true parallelism is required (bypassing Ruby's GIL)
- When memory isolation is critical
- Working with mathematical computations, data processing, or scientific computing

**Key Takeaway:**
The choice between threads and processes should be driven by the nature of the workload, not by general preferences. This benchmark proves that **processes are the optimal choice for CPU-bound tasks**, offering more than 2x better performance by leveraging true parallelism. Understanding this distinction is crucial for building efficient, scalable Ruby applications that can handle computationally intensive workloads effectively.
